# Scenario Analysis and System Expansion Requirements

These scenarios are deliberately chosen to expose inefficiency, missing state, unsafe automation, or architecture pressure. Each scenario includes the capability the system needs in response.

## Scenario 1: 500 companies discovered overnight

A research agent discovers 500 organizations after a market event.

Naive behavior: research all 500 deeply and generate 500 messages.

Required solution:
- cheap first-pass triage;
- deduplication/entity resolution;
- evidence-density and relevance filters;
- bounded research budgets;
- batch observations with per-organization provenance;
- priority queues based on explicit criteria;
- human attention budget;
- progressive enrichment only when the next decision requires it.

Add ResearchBudget, ResearchQueue, and TriageDecision concepts.

## Scenario 2: Same company appears through Reddit, conference list, website, and referral

Required solution:
- canonical identity resolution;
- alias/external identity graph;
- merge candidates with confidence/evidence;
- reversible merge;
- preserve source-specific provenance;
- aggregate without double-counting independent evidence incorrectly.

## Scenario 3: A contact changes jobs

Required solution:
- time-bounded PersonRole/OrganizationAffiliation;
- historical relationships preserved;
- new employer does not inherit old employer's permissions/context;
- campaigns using stale role information generate RefreshContact obligation.

## Scenario 4: Strong engagement but no commercial intent

A post gets large engagement and many positive comments.

Required solution:
- separate attention, engagement, problem recognition, buying intent, opportunity, and revenue evidence;
- prohibit automatic promotion from engagement to demand;
