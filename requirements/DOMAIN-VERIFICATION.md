# Domain Verification and Scenario Test Requirements

The implementation MUST turn the domain requirements into executable tests.

## Required test classes

1. State transition tests for every aggregate.
2. Illegal-transition tests.
3. Invariant property tests where practical.
4. Capability/authorization tests.
5. Obligation-blocking tests.
6. Evidence freshness tests.
7. Negative-knowledge tests.
8. Optimistic-concurrency tests.
9. Idempotency tests.
10. External-effect Unknown/reconciliation tests.
11. Provider duplicate-event tests.
12. Approval version/hash invalidation tests.
13. Suppression/unsubscribe race tests.
14. Campaign pause race tests.
15. Entity merge/unmerge provenance tests.
16. Evidence dependency/cycle tests.
17. Projection rebuild/equivalence tests.
18. Agent authority tests.
19. Cost/budget stop tests.
20. Scenario tests corresponding to every scenario in SCENARIOS-AND-EXPANSION.md.

## Architecture tests

Tests MUST detect:
- provider types leaking into domain;
- direct provider calls from agents;
- domain mutation bypassing transition functions;
- secrets committed as domain data;
- projections used as canonical write models;
- public claims without required evidence/approval;
- unsupported use of JavaScript where Limen/F# should own application behavior.

## Traceability

Every implemented requirement SHOULD be traceable to tests and implementation evidence through ROS once the deferred bootstrap issue is resolved. Until then, requirement IDs and test names SHOULD preserve the mapping needed for later ROS import.
